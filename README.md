# bitcamp 2019: Mortgage Loan Risk Management Data
Data hosted for Bitcamp 2019 utilized by Erin Nordquist for data viz and machine learning. 

## Inspiration
I wanted to use the machine learning concepts I've learned in my classes, and the dataset from Risk Span seemed interesting. I hope to go into Data Science and risk management is a large area of that field. I am also a business minor and taking accounting currently. We have not covered mortgages yet or loans with much depth, but I find I understand financial information well and am always interested in learning more.

## Description
My final result is a Jupyter Notebook hosted by Google Collaboratory accompanied by some visualizations created in Tableau. This details the process I went through during Bitcamp 2019. 

## The Process
I started off naively hoping I could intuitively understand the mortgage terminology in the data. This was a mistake as I spent far too much time looking at the data without context for the numbers I was seeing. I did some cursory research and decided to start with a decision tree classifier. I soon realized the data had limited variability and doubted the high accuracy my classifier was reporting, but I did some of the most important factors to consider. I used this information to guide my data visualisations created using Tableau.  

## Challenges
Time was the largest obstacle, even more so than other hackathons I have been to as I was working alone. I tried to find others interested in machine learning and looking for teammates, but that journey was not successful. I also faced some technical challenges that I was mostly able to overcome, but they detracted further from the time I could dedicate to my project.

## Accomplishments
I am very proud that I managed to submit a project alone especially considering I had no prior knowledge regarding mortgage loans and spent a decent amount of time doing research. I am also proud of the visualizations I made with Tableau as it was my first time ever using this software. 

## What I learned
I learned how to use Google Collaboratory, some Tableau basics, as well as the struggle of submitting a project alone. I must say I far prefer the team experience. I also learned more about the importance of knowing your data and making sure to take all information, both that is given and generated, in the context of the larger situation. Finally I gained experience with time series data which was exciting as I hadn't done much work with timeseries before. 

## What's next for this project
I want to create machine learning models to given predictions or risk values based on account information at different points in time to provide predictive information. I alse hope to use this data set to gain experience with more complex machine learning algorithms that I have only learned about conceptually so far like Neural Networks and unsupervised learning techniques, but I will likely need to combine it with more data from other sources to accomplish this goal.
